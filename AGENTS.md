## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Security and privacy (public repo)

This repository is public. Everything committed is visible on the internet.

- Never commit secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys) or `.env*` files.
- Never commit private personal data (address, phone, IDs) unless the owner explicitly wants it public.
- Use placeholders for unpublished contact details; only ship emails/links the owner approved.
- Put deploy secrets in GitHub Actions secrets / environment variables, not in source.
- If a secret may already be in git history, warn the owner and rotate it — removing the file is not enough.
- When unsure whether content should be public, ask before adding it.
